                <h3>Our Project</h3>
                <p>ABridge is a text type summarization tool using the SpaCy algorithm. SpaCy is a popular NLP library in Python known for its efficiency and accuracy. By leveraging SpaCy, we aim to create a tool that can automatically generate concise and coherent summaries from various text types, including articles, reports, and academic papers.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Utilizes advanced NLP techniques to ensure summaries are accurate and retain the original text's meaning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Designed to process large volumes of text quickly, making it ideal for time-sensitive applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>User-Friendly:</strong> Intuitive interface that allows users to input text and receive summaries in real-time easily.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactivity:</strong> Provides interactive ways of learning for engaging study methods for learning.</li>
